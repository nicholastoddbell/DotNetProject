# Unity2D-CSharp-Flashcards

Welcome to my first Unity 2D Game!

I accomplished four main goals during this project:

1. I created something useful for myself and others.
2. I practiced thinking like a developer.
3. I was able to practice C# outside the context of test automation.
4. I gained exposure to a new and exciting tool.

** A special thanks to my wife for supporting UAT efforts **

How to run:

1. Visit my GitHubPage at https://nicholastoddbell.github.io/Unity2D-CSharp-Flashcards/index.html
2. Press 1 to move forward, 2 to move backward, and 3 to exit.

I look forward to enhancing this project while adding new flashcards.
